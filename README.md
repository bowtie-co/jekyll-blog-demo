## Checklist

- [x] New Jekyll Project
  - *Already done, this repo is a fresh `jekyll new ...` project*
  - See [https://jekyllrb.com/docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) for more info
- [ ] Review expected file usage & structure
  - `page` uses `layout`
  - `page` `layout` contains an `include` for listing items
  - each `item` is output to a new `layout`
- [ ] Build a collection of content block items
  - Each content block item should have a `title` and `subtitle` in the `frontmatter` and some lorem in the main content (below the frontmatter)
  - Each content block item should also have a `published` setting in the frontmatter
    - *This should be a `boolean` field type (values: `true` | `false`)*
    - **Note:** *`yaml` [supports a wide range of "valid" boolean values](https://yaml.org/type/bool.html)*, but `true` / `false` is most common.
- [ ] In a new section (or include snippet), loop through each item in your collection and output them into content blocks, omitting any blocks whose `published` setting is `false`.
- [ ] Create a page to hold that section (homepage is fine) and render into the browser.
  - **Note: Don't forget to export the `collection`, `section` and `page` from the `_config.yml`**
  - See [https://jekyllrb.com/docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) for more info
- [ ] Create several *(at least 3)* items (posts) under your new collection
  - At least 1 where: `published=true`
  - At least 1 where: `published=false`
  - Test different data/values in "frontmatter" and content blocks
- [ ] Commit changes *(can use a new/custom branch name)*
- [ ] Push changes *(to **your** forked repo)*
- [ ] Open a pull request against this repo (`bowtie-co/jekyll-blog-demo`)
- [ ] Add any additional info and/or questions you might have
