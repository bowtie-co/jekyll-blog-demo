Strawberries are among the first fruit to ripen in the Northeast.

The flower buds formed last fall and were tucked away under a layer of straw for the winter. Then an early-spring heat wave pushed the plants along. That made the flowers open early, and growers kept busy protecting them from frost on cold nights, using sprinklers to form ice, which funny as it sounds, gives off heat when it forms. Now the berries are ready and hopefully the weather will be good throughout the harvest period so fruit losses are minimal and the customers come out and pick, too.

Not that long ago commercial strawberry production didnâ€™t even exist.  True, the Roman poets Virgil and Ovid did mention the strawberry way back in the first century A.D., but they referenced it as an ornamental, not as a food.  Wild strawberries have been eaten by people around the world since ancient times, but not in large quantities since the fruits were small or tough or lacked flavor.
