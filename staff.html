<p>Great websites are made by great teams. We have the best talent, from an encyclopedic knowledge of every viral Tweet that was stolen from a Tumblr post (Talia) to website development skills (SarahMay), to the ability to sit still all day staring out a window and then go completely bouncing-off-the-walls mad without fail every night at 11 PM (Buffy), our unique team is the best around.</p>
